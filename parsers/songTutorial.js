Using our simple yet powerful mark-up language,\nwe make it easy to write easy-to-read chord sheets. This is an overview of what \nyou can do with it. Feel free to mess around and try things for yourself here!\n\n{Seeing is believing}\nWhen you type in our mark-up language on the {bold}left{end bold} side,\nyou see what a printed-outsheet looks like on the {bold}right{end bold} side. \nIt's easy to see what you'll get.\n\n{Exactly where it should go}\nLet say you want a chord above a word. Then simply put the chord\nin square brackets before the [Ebmaj7]word like this. Magic! It appears perfectly\nabove where you wanted. You can also make comments<like this comment> on the line above\nusing angled brackets. You can even put chords mid[Csus/G]word.\n\nIf you have line with just chords, put a '%' at the beginning of the line, like this:\n%   [A]   [D]   [E]   -   ||  [F#m] [Bm7] [Esus] [E]  ||   [A]\nYou can also put other stuff and spaces as you like.\n\nBy putting chords in brackets, you ensure clean tranposition. You can use the tranpose feature when viewing and writing; \n\n{Look here!}\nYou can also format your lyrics with {bold}bold{end bold} tags and {italic}italic{end italic} tags -- even {bold}{ital}both{endbold}{endital}\n if you like. Also, you can make {header}headers{end header} with {header 250%}variable{end header} {header 80%}sizes{end header}.\nNote that {bold}<comment>bold{endbold} and {italic}[C]italic{enditalic} tags don't affect chords or chord comments, which are bolded and italic.\n\nIf you have a guitar/bass/ukelele/whatever tab, enclose it in tab tags like this:\n{tab}\nE|---0----2---0---|\nB|---0----3---2---|\nG|---1----2---2---|\nD|---2----0---2---|\nA|---2--------0---|\nE|---0------------| (3x)\n{end tab}\nThis will ensure proper character sizing.\n\n{Sections and Ordering}\nLabel the start of a new section with curly braces, like the name of this section.\nSome more typical examples might be Verse 1, Chorus, etc.\n\nIf you want to display these sections in a certain order, perhaps different from \nthe order written, begin the first line of the document like this:\n                 Order: Verse 1, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus, *Chorus\nAn asterisk (*) will cause the name of the section to print, but not the content. \nNote that anything before the first labeled section will always be printed at the top. \n\n{Chorus} I'm printed twice\n{Verse 1}I'm printed first but written second\n{Verse 2}My content is only printed the first time\n{Importing songs from elsewhere}\nHave a favorite chord sheet or tab from another website? Simply copy and paste the \n text into the import feature and Enchord will do its best to put it\ninto our mark-up language for easy manipulation.";
