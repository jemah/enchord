{Welcome!}
Hello, and welcome to Enchord! Using our simple yet powerful mark-up language,
we make it easy to write easy-to-read chord sheets. This is an overview of what 
you can do with it. Feel free to mess around and try things for yourself here!

{Seeing is believing}
When you type in our mark-up language on the {bold}left{end bold} side,
you see what a printed-outsheet looks like on the {bold}right{end bold} side. 
It's easy to see what you'll get.

{Exactly where it should go}
Let say you want a chord above a word. Then simply put the chord
in square brackets before the [Ebmaj7]word like this. Magic! It appears perfectly
above where you wanted. You can also make comments<like this comment> on the line above
using angled brackets. You can even put chords mid[Csus/G]word.

If you have line with just chords, put a '%' at the beginning of the line, like this:
%   [A]   [D]   [E]   -   ||  [F#m] [Bm7] [Esus] [E]  ||   [A]
You can also put other stuff and spaces as you like.

By putting chords in brackets, you ensure clean tranposition. You can use the tranpose feature when viewing and writing; 

{Look here!}
You can also format your lyrics with {bold}bold{end bold} tags and {italic}italic{end italic} tags -- even {bold}{ital}both{endbold}{endital}
 if you like. Also, you can make {header}headers{end header} with {header 250%}variable{end header} {header 80%}sizes{end header}.
Note that {bold}<comment>bold{endbold} and {italic}[C]italic{enditalic} tags don't affect chords or chord comments, which are bolded and italic.

If you have a guitar/bass/ukelele/whatever tab, enclose it in tab tags like this:
{tab}
E|---0----2---0---|
B|---0----3---2---|
G|---1----2---2---|
D|---2----0---2---|
A|---2--------0---|
E|---0------------| (3x)
{end tab}
This will ensure proper character sizing.

{Sections and Ordering}
Label the start of a new section with curly braces, like the name of this section.
Some more typical examples might be Verse 1, Chorus, etc.

If you want to display these sections in a certain order, perhaps different from 
the order written, begin the first line of the document like this:
                 Order: Verse 1, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus, *Chorus
An asterisk (*) will cause the name of the section to print, but not the content. 
Note that anything before the first labeled section will always be printed at the top. 

{Chorus} I'm printed twice
{Verse 1}I'm printed first but written second
{Verse 2}My content is only printed the first time
{Importing songs from elsewhere}
Have a favorite chord sheet or tab from another website? Simply copy and paste the 
 text into the import feature and Enchord will do its best to put it
into our mark-up language for easy manipulation.
