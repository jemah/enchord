{Welcome!} 
Hello, and welcome to Enchord! Using our simple yet powerful mark-up language, 
we make it easy to write easy-to-read chord sheets. This is an overview of what  
you can do with it. If you hit the 'Edit Song' button, you can see how writing songs work. 
Feel free to mess around and try things for yourself here before you go! 
 
{Getting started} 
When you create a new song, start by filling out the {bold}Song Info{end bold} on the left panel. 
To save, you need a {bold}Title{end bold} and {bold}Artist{end bold} ({bold}Genre{end bold} is optional). For example:  
{bold}Title{end bold}: 10,000 Reasons  
{bold}Artist{end bold}: Matt Redman  
{bold}Genre{end bold}: Worship 
 
{Seeing is believing} 
When you type in our mark-up language on the {bold}left{end bold} side, 
you see what a printed-outsheet looks like on the {bold}right{end bold} side.  
It's easy to see what you'll get.You can even choose from  
different fonts and font sizes for the output. 
 
{Exactly where it should go} 
Let say you want a chord above a word. Then simply put the chord 
in square brackets before the [Ebmaj7]word like this. Magic! It appears perfectly 
above where you wanted. You can also make comments<like this comment> on the line above 
using angled brackets. You can even put chords mid[Csus/G]word.//And if you put words after two forward slashes, it won't show. Sneaky. 
 
If you have line with just chords, put a '%' at the beginning of the line, like this: 
%   [A]   [D]   [E]   -   ||  [F#m] [Bm7] [Esus] [E]  ||   [A] 
You can also put other stuff and spaces as you like. 
 
 {Transpose away}By putting chords in brackets, you ensure clean tranposition.  
You can use the "Transpose" feature when viewing and editing a song.  
While viewing, it will render the new chords temporarily; while editing it  
will change the markup file itself.  
In either case, simply choose how many half-steps up or down to  
tranpose, and whether you prefer chords with flats or sharps in them. 
 
{Look here!} 
You can also format your lyrics with {bold}bold{end bold} tags and {italic}italic{end italic} tags -- even {bold}{ital}both{endbold}{endital} 
if you like. Also, you can make {header}headers{end header} with {header 250%}variable{end header} {header 80%}sizes{end header}. 
Note that {bold}<comment>bold{endbold} and {italic}[C]italic{enditalic} tags don't affect chords or chord comments, which are bolded and italic. 
Also, not every font supports bold and italics. Sorry! 
 
If you have a guitar/bass/ukelele/whatever tab, enclose it in tab tags like this: 
{tab} 
E|---0----2---0---| 
B|---0----3---2---| 
G|---1----2---2---| 
D|---2----0---2---| 
A|---2--------0---| 
E|---0------------| (3x) 
{end tab} 
This will use an appropriate monospaced font on the tab to ensure proper character alignment. 
 
{Sections and ordering} 
Label the start of a new section with curly braces, like the name of this section. 
Some more typical examples might be Verse 1, Chorus, etc. 
 
If you want to display these sections in a certain order, perhaps different from  
the order written, begin the first line of the document like this: 
               Order: Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, *Verse 2, ^Chorus 
A caret (^) will cause the name of the section to print, but not the content. 
An asterisk (*) will cause the contents of a section to print, but not the name. 
Anything before the first labeled section will always be printed at the top. 
Try messing with the "Order" line at the top of the document!  
 
{Chorus}My content is only printed the first time 
{Verse 1}I'm printed first but written second 
{Verse 2}I'm printed twice 
{Importing songs from elsewhere} 
Have a favorite chord sheet or tab from another website? Simply copy and paste the  
 text into the {bold}Import{end bold} feature and Enchord will do its best to put it 
into our mark-up language for easy manipulation. 
 
{Sharing sheets with the world} 
Any song you own is either {bold}Public{end bold} or {bold}Private{end bold}, as set on the left panel while editing. 
Any {bold}Public{end bold} song can be searched and viewed by any visitor to the site 
As a user, you can copy any {bold}Public{end bold} song to your personal library, then edit it as you please! 
Users can also give sheets they like stars so the others can find the best sheets too!
